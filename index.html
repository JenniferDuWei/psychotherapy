      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        I am a counsellor offering a warm, reflective, and collaborative space
        for people who want to understand themselves more deeply and find new
        ways of being with their experiences.

      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>
        My approach is grounded in person-centred and relational therapy.
        I value empathy, honesty, and moving at a pace that feels right for you.
        Therapy is not about fixing, but about making sense of what matters.
      </p>

      <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
      <p>
        I work with adults experiencing anxiety, low mood, shame,
        relationship difficulties, and questions around identity and meaning.
        You do not need to be in crisis to seek therapy.
      </p>

      <h2>Practical Details</h2>
      <p>
        Sessions are offered online / in person (delete as appropriate).
        I offer a free initial conversation so we can see whether working
        together feels right.
